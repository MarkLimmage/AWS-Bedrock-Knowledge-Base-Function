# Task 3 Implementation - Before and After

## Problem Statement
The RAG system was generating appropriate context documents, but the generate phase was not aware of how the retrieved documents related to the specific requirements of the question. The LLM operated on raw text without seeing metadata that was used to filter chunks.

## Solution
Refactored the prompt construction to explicitly include metadata alongside retrieved chunks, making the link between metadata and content visible to the LLM.

## Before (Task 2)

### Prompt sent to LLM:
```
The following information was retrieved from a knowledge base:

[Document 1 (Source: s3://bucket/ml-guide.pdf)]
This document discusses machine learning algorithms.

[Document 2 (Source: s3://bucket/deep-learning.pdf)]
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.

Based on this information, please answer the following question:
What is machine learning?
```

**Issue:** No metadata visible to LLM. It couldn't verify if documents matched specific query requirements (e.g., "documents from John Smith" or "documents from August 2025").

## After (Task 3)

### Prompt sent to LLM:
```
The following information was retrieved from a knowledge base. Each document includes metadata that provides important context about the document (such as author, creation date, category, etc.) and should be considered when answering the question.

[Document 1]
Metadata:
  - author_name: John Smith
  - created_at_iso: 2025-08-15T10:30:00Z
  - created_at_unix: 1723719000
  - category: technology

Source: s3://bucket/ml-guide.pdf

Content:
This document discusses machine learning algorithms.

[Document 2]
Metadata:
  - author_name: Jane Doe
  - created_at_iso: 2025-09-01T14:00:00Z
  - created_at_unix: 1725199200
  - category: AI

Source: s3://bucket/deep-learning.pdf

Content:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.

Based on this information and the associated metadata, please answer the following question:
What is machine learning?

When answering, consider the metadata to ensure your response is relevant to the specific requirements of the question (e.g., if the question asks about documents from a specific author or time period, use the metadata to verify the document's relevance).
```

**Improvement:** Metadata is now explicitly visible! The LLM can:
- Verify document authors match query requirements
- Check temporal relevance (creation dates)
- Understand document categories
- Provide contextually accurate responses

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
**File:** `aws_bedrock_kb_function.py`
**Method:** `query_knowledge_base()`
**Lines Changed:** ~30 lines in the context building section

### Key Modifications:
1. **Extract metadata from results:** `result.get('metadata', {})`
2. **Format metadata in prompt:** Loop through metadata fields and format as key-value pairs
3. **Add explicit instructions:** Tell LLM to consider metadata when answering
4. **Graceful handling:** System works correctly even when metadata is absent

### Testing
**New Test File:** `test_metadata_in_prompt.py`

Two comprehensive tests:
1. **Metadata Extraction Test:** Validates all metadata fields appear in prompt
2. **Metadata Absence Test:** Ensures graceful handling when metadata is missing

**Results:** 8/8 tests passing (6 existing + 2 new)

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ More accurate answers to specific queries (e.g., "documents from author X")
- ✅ Better temporal context (e.g., "recent documents" or "documents from 2025")
- ✅ Improved relevance verification

### For Developers:
- ✅ Minimal code changes (~30 lines)
- ✅ Backward compatible (works with or without metadata)
- ✅ Well-tested (comprehensive test coverage)
- ✅ Security verified (0 CodeQL vulnerabilities)

### For the System:
- ✅ Better context awareness in generation phase
- ✅ More precise RAG pipeline
- ✅ Leverages full capabilities of knowledge base metadata

## Example Use Case

**User Query:** "Show me machine learning documents written by John Smith in August 2025"

**Before Task 3:**
- Retrieval: Filters correctly using metadata
- Generation: LLM sees only text, can't verify if authors/dates match
- Risk: May include irrelevant information or miss context

**After Task 3:**
- Retrieval: Filters correctly using metadata ✓
- Generation: LLM sees text AND metadata (author, date) ✓
- Benefit: LLM can verify "this is indeed from John Smith in August 2025" ✓
- Result: More accurate, contextually-aware response ✓

## Conclusion

Task 3 successfully makes metadata visible to the generation phase, completing the RAG pipeline enhancement. The LLM now has full awareness of document context, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Tests:** ✅ 8/8 passing
**Code Review:** ✅ Approved (issues addressed)
**Security:** ✅ 0 vulnerabilities
**Documentation:** ✅ Updated
